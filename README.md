# Speaking at HHTML
First of all, thank you for thinking about submitting a talk to an upcoming HHTML event. We're happy you're here :rainbow:

### How do I submit a talk?

[Open an issue](https://github.com/hhtml-de/call-for-proposals/issues/new/choose) on this repo and use one of our issue templates to guide you through your talk submission.

If you need any help with this process because you are new to GitHub, git or speaking in general, send us a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hhhtml). Happy to help any way we can!

### What should I talk about?

We'd like to cover HTML and related topics in the meetup. Some topic fields of interest are semantic markup, accessibility, screen readers, SEO, performance and progressive enhancement. But it is not limited to that.

Anything you're passionate about is welcome. The talks don't have to be technical (but they certainly can be). The most important thing is that you're excited about your topic. That's the amazing thing about public speaking - you get to share your passions with the world. Just keep in mind that all talks must follow our [Code of Conduct](https://hhtml.de/code-of-conduct/).

### How long should my talk be?

At every event, we plan to have a mix of longer 20-25 m
inute talks and 5-10 minute lightning talks. So do whatever you feel most comfortable with! If you need more time to present, please let us know so we can adjust the schedule or coordinate with the venue.

### Where does HHTML happen?

HHTML meetups happen fully remote. 
You can check the [HHTML website](https://hhtml.de/) for a list of the upcoming (and past) meetups. 

### What's the talk selection process?

Talk slots are first come, first served (for the most part). After you open your issue, one of the organizers will reach out and let you know the next steps :tada:
